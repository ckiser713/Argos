Cortex Development Environment
==========================================

Python: Python 3.11.14
Node.js: v20.19.5
pnpm: 10.23.0
Poetry: Poetry (version 2.2.1)

ROCm Integration:
  - ROCm wheels: /home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels
  - ROCm binaries: /home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/bin (added to PATH)
  - PIP_FIND_LINKS configured for offline PyTorch installation

Environment variables set:
  - CORTEX_ENV=dev
  - CORTEX_QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
  - PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/home/nexus/.cache/ms-playwright
  - PIP_FIND_LINKS=/home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels/torch2.9:/home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels/common
  - PIP_NO_INDEX not set (allows Poetry/pip to access PyPI)
  - For ROCm packages, use: pip install --no-index --find-links $HOME/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels/...

To install PyTorch from ROCm wheels:
  pip install --find-links /home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels/torch2.9 torch torchvision torchaudio
  pip install --find-links /home/nexus/rocm/py311-tor290/wheels/common triton tokenizers

ROCm binaries available:
  ✓ llama-cpp (ROCm-optimized)

  - Installing tree-sitter-languages (1.10.2)

    | Unable to find installation candidates for tree-sitter-languages (1.10.2)
    | 
    | This is likely not a Poetry issue.
    | 
    |   - 59 candidate(s) were identified for the package
    |   - 59 wheel(s) were skipped as your project's environment does not support the identified abi tags
    | 
    | Solutions:
    | Make sure the lockfile is up-to-date. You can try one of the following;
    | 
    |     1. Regenerate lockfile: poetry lock --no-cache --regenerate
    |     2. Update package     : poetry update --no-cache tree-sitter-languages
    | 
    | If neither works, please first check to verify that the tree-sitter-languages has published wheels available from your configured source that are compatible with your environment- ie. operating system, architecture (x86_64, arm64 etc.), python interpreter.
    | 
    | You can also run your poetry command with -v to see more information.
