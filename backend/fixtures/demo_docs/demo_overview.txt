Cortex Demo Workspace

This workspace is preloaded with a concise description of Cortex so that end-to-end smoke tests have something to ingest, embed, and search.

Key goals:
- Keep ingest fast (tiny text files only).
- Cover both documentation-style and list-style content.
- Provide predictable search terms like "ingest pipeline", "vector search", and "roadmap".
